# Language as Data 1

## Online Lecture Notes:
- ##### Overview of "Data"
	- **Etymology and Definition**
		- Derived from the Latin word **datum** (something given).
		- Defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as collective information, often numerical, used for analysis, reference, or computation.
		- In computing: quantities, characters, or symbols processed collectively.
	- **Public Perception of Data**
		- Often linked to concepts like big data, AI, and digitization.
		- Popular images depict data as abstract, impersonal, and intimidating.
		- However, these representations often exaggerate the power of data systems.
- ##### Algorithms and Their Relationship to Data
	- **Definition:**
		- A set of rules or procedures for calculation or problem-solving.
		- Algorithms are implemented in programming languages (e.g., Python, Java) and executed as software components.
	- **Interaction with Data:**
		- Algorithms process input data to generate output, forming the backbone of software systems.
- ##### Contextualizing Data in Social and Technical Discourses
	- **Two Approaches to Conceptualizing Data:**
		1. **Traditional View:**
			- Data as "given" an objective, forming the basis for knowledge and decision-making.
			- Criticism: Data collection always involves *selection* and *contextualization*, making it a *subjective process*.
		2. **Critical Perspective:**
			- Data as "reinterpretation" or formalization of complex phenomena.
			- ISO/IEC defines data as a formalized representation suitable for communication and processing.
	- **Implications:**
		- Data is not neutral but shaped by social, cultural, and institutional contexts.
		- Collecting and interpreting data is a constructive process, influenced by perspectives and interests.
- ##### Critical Data Studies
	- **Key Points:**
		- Data reflects and reinforces power structures (e.g., corporate control, algorithmic biases).
		- Researchers emphasize that data is *"cooked,"* not *"raw,"* shaped by selection and recontextualization.
		- Examples of biased data systems:
			- Gender and racial biases in facial recognition.
			- Misguided word associations in language models (e.g., Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker)
			- Algorithms optimized for efficiency, often ignoring individual and societal impacts.
- ##### Applications and Challenges
	- **Data in Journalism and Politics**
		- Data journalism analyzes structured information to uncover newsworthy stories (e.g., emergency services coverage, election analytics).
		- Data-driven campaigns, such as Barack Obama's election strategy, illustrate the growing influence of big data in politics.
		- The misuse of data (e.g., disinformation) highlights its role as a form of power.
	- **Ethical Concerns:**
		- The need for iterative improvements and debugging of data systems.
		- Questions about fairness, transparency, and accountability in algorithmic decision-making.
		- Challenges in identifying and mitigating unintended harms caused by data systems.
- ##### Key Quotes and Insights
	- "Data is always reinterpreted information"
	- Algorithms often prioritize efficiency and profitability over individual well-being and societal health.
	- "Data are never raw but always cooked" â€” emphasizes the constructed nature of data.
- ##### Closing Thoughts

## Lecture Notes
 - ##### Two paths of conceptualisation of "data" as a term:
	 1. Data is something given that can be captured and further processed. Data does not have a meaning by itself.
		 - **Criticique:** Data gets always selected, perspectivated and contextualised *when collected.*
	2. Data is something that can be obtained by reduction, selection or formalization from unites with a higher degree of complexity. Data is always cooked, and is never raw.
- **IT perspective:**
	- A reinterpretable representation of information in a formalized manner, suitable for communication, interpretation, or processing. Examples of data include a sequence of bits, a table of numbers, the characters on a page, the recording of sounds made by a person speaking, or a moon rock specimen.
- **In Digital Discourse Analysis:**
	- A datum is a phenomenon interpreted as a sign, which in the course of a research process is extracted from a given complexion and recontextualized.
- ##### Critical Data Studies
	- "Data as a form of power"
		- Controlling data
		- Manipulating data
		- Gathering Data
