## Video Lecture Notes:
This lecture continues the exploration of the relationship between **data, knowledge, and meaning in discourse**, focusing on the **inferred meaning** that emerges beyond explicit textual content. It introduces and elaborates on **three key pragmatic concepts essential for understanding how we interpret discourse:**
### 1. Common Ground:
Proposed by **Herbert Clark**, **common ground** refers to the **shared information, experiences, and assumptions** that interlocutors rely on to achieve mutual understanding in communication.
- **Key Idea:** Understanding requires more than just a common language; it depends on **trust and shared situational knowledge**.
- **Example:** A father and his son on the beach both know that they are observing a shell, hearing the sea, and feeling the sun. They also know that the other is aware of this shared experience.
- **Expanding to Larger Communities:** In written or professional contexts where interlocutors do not share physical space, **cultural communities (e.g., academic disciplines, social groups)** serve as surrogates for physical shared environments.
### 2. Implicature:
Developed by **Paul Grice**, implicature refers to **the additional meanings inferred from an utterance that are not explicitly stated**. Grice introduced the **Cooperative Principle**, which underpins how we interpret these implicit meanings. The principle suggests that speakers generally aim to contribute meaningfully to a conversation according to the accepted purposes of the exchange.
- **Conversational Maxims:** Grice identified **four maxims** that guide cooperative conversation:
    - **Quality:** Be truthful.
    - **Quantity:** Be as informative as necessary.
    - **Relation:** Be relevant.
    - **Manner:** Be clear and orderly.
- **Violations and Implicature:**
    - **Deliberate or accidental breaches** of these maxims can produce **implicatures**.
    - **Example:**
        - Host says: "It’s getting late."
        - Guest infers: "It’s time to leave."
    - A speaker violating **Quality** (e.g., saying “George is very smart” when he failed an exam) may **imply sarcasm**.
### 3. Presupposition:
Discussed by **Stephen Levinson**, presupposition is **the background knowledge assumed to be true for an utterance to make sense**.
- **Key Idea:** A presupposition remains intact even when the sentence is negated.
- **Example:**
    - Sentence: "Unfortunately, there will be some impacts of climate change that we won’t be able to avoid."
    - Presupposition: **Climate change exists.**
    - Even if the sentence is negated (e.g., “There won’t be impacts...”), **the assumption that climate change exists persists**.
- **Courtroom Example:**
    - Question: "Do you regret killing him?"
    - Presupposes: The person killed someone.
    - Regardless of a "yes" or "no" response, the presupposition stands.
### Significance of These Concepts:
These pragmatic mechanisms demonstrate that **comprehending discourse involves more than decoding words**; it requires **activating background knowledge, making inferences, and recognizing what is left unsaid**.
- **Understanding Texts:** Knowledge of **common ground, implicature, and presupposition** is crucial for interpreting both **everyday conversation and complex texts**.
- **Challenges for Analysts:** **Discourse analysts must navigate the boundary between what is explicitly stated and what is inferred**, recognizing that much of the meaning in communication is constructed **beyond the surface of the text**.
### Conclusion:
The lecture reinforces the **interactive and context-dependent nature of meaning** in discourse. **Mutual knowledge, inferential reasoning, and shared assumptions** enable individuals to **bridge gaps between linguistic expression and understanding**, making these pragmatic tools **indispensable for discourse analysis**.
- **What is knowledge?**
	- Meaning of the word: the sum of all assumptions about the world that are **shared in a group or society** and are considered **true**
	- "I know that fruit trees bloom in spring." **vs** "I know that apples taste better than pears."
		- shared undisputed assumption **vs** subjective judgement
	- **Implicit Knowledge**: Experience-based knowledge that is not always obvious but essential, gained through practical application.
	- **Declarative Knowledge**: Facts and information that describe what something is or how it works.
- Our personal knowledge has 3 sources:
	- Experience
	- Discourse
	- Inferences that we draw out of discursive information based on our own personal experience with the material world

## Live Lecture Notes:
- There are different school of thoughts when it comes to the nature of "knowledge"
	- there are some argue that there is knowledge outside of language
	- there are others, which says we need a semiotic structure to know what we know, to distinguish between different knowledges
- Different types of knowledge:
	- Implicit Knowledge
	- Declarative Knowledge
- Three sources of personal knowledge according to Teun van Dijk
	- Experience (touch, feel, sight)
	- Discourse
	- Inferences we draw either from experiences or discursive knowledge: conclusions — if the streets are wet, then it must have been raining recently
- Knowledge means, experiencing the world in a social way, so it is a shared perspective in a way
- Frame Analysis
- Contextualizationxz
