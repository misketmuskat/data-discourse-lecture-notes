Guest Lecture: 
**Corpus Approaches to Risk**
Prof. Dr. Jens Zinn, University of Melbourne

This lecture introduces **corpus linguistics** as a method for analyzing discourse, emphasizing its role in uncovering patterns through **statistical exploration** and **contextual analysis**. The speaker uses the analogy of exploring a medieval city (Passau) to explain the dual need for **macro-level structural analysis** (satellite view) and **micro-level contextual examination** (on-the-ground observation) in discourse studies. Below is a detailed breakdown of the key concepts and methodologies:

---
### 1. The Analogy of Passau: Macro vs. Micro Analysis
- **Macro-Level (Satellite View)**:
    - Involves **statistical exploration** to identify broad patterns (e.g., word frequencies, collocations).
    - Example: Analyzing the "street network" of discourse through tools like keyword analysis.
- **Micro-Level (Ground View)**:
    - Requires **close reading of texts** to understand context, nuance, and function.
    - Example: Examining specific phrases or metaphors in a political speech.
- **Integration**: Effective discourse analysis combines both approaches, akin to understanding Passau’s layout by observing its streets and landmarks while also viewing its topography from afar.
---
### 2. Defining a Corpus
A **corpus** is a **machine-readable collection of authentic texts** produced in natural language contexts (not elicited for research). Corpora are categorized into:
- **Specialized Corpora**: Focused on a specific topic, genre, or discourse (e.g., climate change debates).
- **Reference Corpora**: Broadly representative of a language/variety (e.g., the **British National Corpus**).
- **Balanced Corpora**: Include diverse genres, media, and topics to approximate linguistic diversity.
- **Large Versatile Corpora**: Massive collections (e.g., web-crawled texts) that allow user-defined sub-corpus creation.

**Key Challenge**: **Representativeness**
- Corpora aim to reflect a "population" of texts (e.g., all English tweets about climate change), but this population is often undefined.
- **Three Solutions**:
    1. **Large Versatile Corpora**: Maximize volume but lack structure.
    2. **Balanced Corpora**: Strive for genre/media diversity.
    3. **Specialized Corpora**: Target specific discourses (optimal for focused studies).
---
### 3. Limitations of Corpora
- **No Inherent Meaning**: Corpora contain **textual data**, not pre-packaged meanings. Analysts must reconstruct meaning through:
    - **Collocation Analysis**: Identifying words that frequently co-occur (e.g., "climate" + "crisis").
    - **Keyword Analysis**: Comparing word frequencies against a reference corpus to pinpoint discourse-specific terms.
- **Example**: In climate change discourse, terms like "mitigation" or "carbon footprint" gain significance through their statistical prominence and contextual usage.

### 4. Methodologies in Corpus Linguistics
##### **a. John Rupert Firth’s Principle**
- **"You shall know a word by the company it keeps"**: A word’s meaning is derived from its **linguistic environment** (collocations) and **situational context**.
- **Application**: Analyzing the word "mitigation" in climate discourse reveals associations like "adoption of mitigation strategies" or "cost-effective mitigation.
##### **b. Layers of Social Discourse in Corpora**
1. **Linguistic Expressions**: Surface-level text (e.g., "climate emergency").
2. **Concepts**: Reconstructed meanings (e.g., "global warming" as a threat).
3. **Linguistic Practices**: Actions performed through language (e.g., warnings, denials).
4. **Social Practices**: Real-world actions linked to discourse (e.g., policy changes).
**Example:**
- **Expression**: "Net-zero emissions."
- **Concept**: A target for balancing greenhouse gases.
- **Linguistic Practice**: Advocating for legislative action.
- **Social Practice**: Governments enacting carbon taxes.
##### **c. Practical Tools: Corpus Workbench (CWB)**
- **Corpus Query Language (CQL)**: A syntax for searching corpora (e.g., `[lemma="mitigation"%c]` to find all forms of "mitigation").
- **Concordance Analysis**: Displays search results in context (e.g., "mitigation" paired with "strategies" or "challenges").
- **Collocation Analysis**: Measures statistically significant word pairs (e.g., "mitigation" + "adoption" with a **log-likelihood score of 138.773**).
**Step-by-Step Example**:
1. **Query**: Search for the lemma "mitigation" in a climate corpus.
2. **Concordance**: Review all instances of "mitigation" in context.
3. **Collocation**: Identify words like "adaptation" or "funding" that frequently co-occur with "mitigation."
4. **Keyword Analysis**: Compare term frequencies against a reference corpus (e.g., general English) to isolate climate-specific vocabulary.

### 5. Interdisciplinarity and Validity
- **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Discourse analysis bridges linguistics with sociology, political science, and environmental studies.
    - Example: Linking "climate denial" rhetoric to lobbying practices.
- **Validity Radius**: Researchers must define the scope of their corpus (e.g., "This study covers U.S. media from 2010–2020") to avoid overgeneralization.
---
### 6. Case Study: Climate Change Discourse
- **Expressions**: "Climate crisis," "global warming," "carbon neutrality."
- **Concepts**: Environmental urgency, anthropogenic impact, sustainability.
- **Linguistic Practices**: Scientific reporting, activist mobilization, political rhetoric.
- **Social Practices**: International agreements (Paris Accord), corporate greenwashing.
**Visualization**:
- **Climate Crisis**: Images of protests, wildfires.
- **Global Warming**: Graphs of rising temperatures.
- **Carbon Neutrality**: Infographics on renewable energy.
---
### 7. Challenges and Future Directions
- **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization, lemmatization, and metadata tagging are labor-intensive.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Bias in corpus compilation (e.g., overrepresenting mainstream media).
- **Emerging Trends**:
    - **Multimodal Corpora**: Integrating text, images, and video.
    - **Real-Time Analysis**: Using APIs to study live social media discourse.
---
### Conclusion
Corpus approaches to discourse analysis offer powerful tools for **uncovering patterns** and **reconstructing meanings** in large text collections. By combining **quantitative methods** (collocation, keyword analysis) with **qualitative interpretation**, researchers can map the intricate relationships between language, concepts, and social practices. However, the field demands **interdisciplinary collaboration** and careful attention to the **limitations of representativeness** and **contextual nuance**.
