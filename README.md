## information about the notes
Every Video Lecture Note has its own file. In some notes, there are also some reading notes from that week's articles â€” but this is not true for all of them, I didn't read the last weeks articles. Week 2's lecture is missing, because I just watched the video of it. Week 11 and 12 are missing because there was no video lecture that week.
I realized, that I did something like this: if a concept is vague, unclear, I explained it in more detail and with examples **in Turkish**. So if you see these lines, you can tranlate them, or just skip them if the concept is clear for you.
